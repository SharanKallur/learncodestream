## What is Code Stream?

Code Stream is a service provided as part of VMware vRealize Automation, either as SaaS through VMware Cloud Services or an on-premises deployment.

Code Stream is a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) release pipeline tool that allows developers to model and automate the entire release process. It incorporates a release dashboard to keep track of all the various release KPIs and acts as the glue between all existing DevOps tools in the release process.

Code Stream can help teams to deliver software and code changes faster, more reliably and with higher quality while reducing manual operations and operational risk traditionally associated with releases.  

<!-- CI – Code to Artifact
CD – Release, Deploy, Monitor

What are Code Stream’s capabilities around application deployment, testing, and troubleshooting?

Developers are able to request the latest certified application build from the catalog, deploy and test their changes against a sandbox or existing environment, and track the progress of their code across environments after committing their change.

To accelerate time-to-value, Code Stream also provides pre-built pipeline plugins to tools such as WaveFront and Log Insight for troubleshooting, Harbor and Nexus for repositories, Kubernetes for container orchestration, Ansible for configuration management, and Slack for notifications and collaboration. -->

Code Stream provides a customizable dashboards so that DevOps teams can measure their release KPIs and identify bottlenecks or problem areas in the release process.

Code Stream can be extended using the [Custom Integrations](/Custom-Integrations) feature to interact with almost any 3rd party system that has an API or CLI.
