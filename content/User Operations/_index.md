To provide more granular management and governance of the DevOps timeline, User Operations can be configured to manage the continuation of the pipeline execution. 
When a pipeline is configured with an approval task, the pipeline is paused and queued for user interaction.  These users can monitor approval tasks here on the User Operations tab.

Until a preconfigured user approves or rejects the pipeline task, the pipeline remains stopped. If the required user does not address the User Operation in the time allowed, the pipeline will expire.
