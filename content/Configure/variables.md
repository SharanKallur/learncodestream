Variables are a great way to keep text, secrets etc. that you have to reuse, in your Pipelines, in one central place, to easily manage. 
It's also a good practice, if you need to export your pipelines, to make sure, that sensetive information is not exported as well.

There are 3 types of varuables in CodeStream

- Regular
- Secret
- Restricted
