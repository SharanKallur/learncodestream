Triggers are a way for Code Stream to integrate with Docker, Gerrit, and Git lifecycles. 
Code Stream connects to the respective endpoint through a Webhook.

A Webhook is configured by an administrator for a push or pull request event on the Triggers tab.  Through the webhook, any code change events on the remote repository are received by the trigger in Code Stream.

Activity for Docker, Gerrit, and Git triggers and their webhooks can also be observed on the Triggers tab.
